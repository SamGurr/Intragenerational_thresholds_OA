# Primer design

## Blast
--------
* Identify Pacific geoduck genes for the following mitochondrial proteins involved in differnt 'modes' of free radical production and mechanisms of free radical mitigation and/or alternative mithcondrial pathways:
1. Alternate oxidase
2. NADH dehydrogenase (complex I)
3. Cytocdrome *c* oxidoreductase (complex III)
4. Uncoupling protein (i.e. Mitochondrial carrier protein)

* fasta files assembled for target mitochondrial proteins - prioritized mollusc taxa on NCBI
* identify the putative gene in Pacifice geoduck with Muscle, Augustus, Pfam, and NCBI blast

## Primer3 and EMBOSS
--------
* add here...
