## Data

Physiology - (1) SDR_data =  respirometry data with the PreSens SDRdish (2) Phys.assays = results of total antioxidant, total protein, and ash free dry weight

Chemistry and tank maintanance - Daily and continuous chemistry data from hand held probes, TA titrations, and continuous data log probes (APEX). Also contains flow rates, replicate/fixed sample tracker for downstream physiological and molecular assays

## Scripts


Statistical calclations of holistic carbonate chemistry, data analysis, and figure building of chemistry and physiology data.
Also contains an RShiny app built for calculations of live algae based on the volume, geoduck age, and tank occupancy - used daily during the experiment.

## Output

All figures and tables output from the Scripts folder (1) Phys_Calc (2) Resp.Calculations
