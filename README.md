# Geoduck_transgenerational_OA
This repository contains chemistry and respirometry data from a conditioning experiment on juvenile Pacific geoduck in summer 2019.
Here we explore oxidative stress (caused by OA exposure) as a driver for intragenerational stress memory.
Pediveliger geoduck (~30 days old) were exposed to either moderately elevated pCO2 (pH 7.3; Ω 0.4) or ambient conditions (pH 7.8; Ω > 1) since April 2019;
our experimenal approach targets the following hypothesis:

H: Animals conditioned under moderate pCO2 will

(1) sustain energy homeostasis during subsequent stress exposure and increased biochemical resilience against oxidative damage (i.e. reduced antioxidant proteins) and

(2) DNA methylation patterns are altered from stress conditioning and affiliated with modulated expression of CSR proteins to cope with subsequent stress encounters (i.e. acid/base regulation: type-v H+ATPase; antioxidants: catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase; metabolic flexibility: alternative oxidase and ubiquitin; sensory and repair of macromolecules: FtsH, lon protease.

(3) Oxidative stress conditioning (or “mitohormesis”) is elicited from intermittent severe stress exposure (pessimum range) and optimizes the longevity of transient DNA methylation patterns and energy homeostasis.
